# 🤖 GPT-4 Multi-Agent Test Engineer 🤖

Welcome to the GPT-4 Multi-Agent Test Engineer project! This innovative tool leverages the power of GPT-4 to automate the creation of tests, making your testing process more efficient and intelligent. 🚀

## 📋 Project Overview

### What is it?
The GPT-4 Multi-Agent Test Engineer is a sophisticated testing assistant designed to generate test cases, scripts, and scenarios for a wide range of applications and software systems.

### Cost Awareness

It's crucial to be aware of the potential costs associated with using the OpenAI API, as costs can accumulate based on usage. While the GPT-4 Multi-Agent Test Engineer offers powerful testing capabilities, it's essential to keep an eye on your API usage to manage expenses effectively.

### Features
- 🧠 Powered by GPT-4: Harness the advanced natural language processing capabilities of GPT-4.
- 🤝 Multi-Agent Collaboration: Collaborate with multiple test agents for comprehensive testing coverage.
- 📜 Test Script Generation: Automatically generate tests for your applications.
- 🎯 Specific: By implementing a highly specialized Multi-Agent approach, we aim to keep costs significantly lower compared to requesting the same task from AutoGPT or BabyAGI.
- 🚦 Test Automation: Seamlessly integrate with test automation frameworks.
- 📦 Customizable: Tailor the test engineer to your specific testing needs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you start using the GPT-4 Multi-Agent Test Engineer, ensure you have the following:
- Node.js v16 (npm)
- OpenAI API Key (Get one at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aal89/gpt4-multi-agent-test-engineer.git
   cd gpt4-multi-agent-test-engineer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Set up your GPT-4 API key (or create a .env file):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

4. Start the GPT-4 Multi-Agent Test Engineer:
   ```bash
   npm run start
